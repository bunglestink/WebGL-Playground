WebGL-Playground
================

Overview
--------

This isn't anything in particular, just playing around w/ Chrome's experimental WebGL facilities.  In its first iteration, I was following a basic example from http://learningwebgl.com/blog/?p=28, then I added a tight game loop and animated it.  

If I get the hang of this, it will probably mutate into some sort of 3d physics simulation.  Not exactly impressive, but I would just like to see something cool.  If this goes good, I would like to make a simple F-117 simulator.
